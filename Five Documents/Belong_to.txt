"When I talk to people attending other universities I’m surprised to find out that they rely on teaching assistants for help when they have questions or problems. Most professors in the ERS program at Trent have set office hours and attend labs, so you’re able to access them personally as needed."

Dr. Shaun Watmough

Associate Professor
(Liverpool University)

(on leave Jan-June 2014)

(705) 748-1011 ext. 7876

ESC A132


Interests include:

Ecosystems are threatened by a multitude of environmental stresses ranging from disturbance at local scales to global climate change. I am interested in how ecosystems respond to environmental stress, which also requires a greater understanding of how stresses impact on ecosystems. My research focuses on the impacts of acid rain, climate change, nutrient depletion, forestry and metals on forest and lake ecosystems. The research studies range from long-term catchment scale programs to short term laboratory isotope tracer experiments. Information from these studies is used to develop predictive models that are used to estimate the response of ecosystems to environmental stresses.
