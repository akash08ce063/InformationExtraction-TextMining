Award-Winning ERS Faculty

Award-Winning Trent Faculty

*******

&quot;When I talk to people attending other universities I’m surprised to find out that they rely on teaching assistants for help when they have questions or problems. Most professors in the ERS program at Trent have set office hours and attend labs, so you’re able to access them personally as needed.&quot;

(705) 748-1011 ext. 7876

ESC A132


Interests include:

Ecosystems are threatened by a multitude of environmental stresses ranging from disturbance at local scales to global climate change. I am interested in how ecosystems respond to environmental stress, which also requires a greater understanding of how stresses impact on ecosystems. My research focuses on the impacts of acid rain, climate change, nutrient depletion, forestry and metals on forest and lake ecosystems. The research studies range from long-term catchment scale programs to short term laboratory isotope tracer experiments. Information from these studies is used to develop predictive models that are used to estimate the response of ecosystems to environmental stresses.

Interests include:

The major focus has been the development and evaluation of mass balance models which describe the fate of chemicals in the environment. Applications include the phenomena of bioaccumulation in food chains, prediction of the fate of contaminants in the Great Lakes and in regions of Canada and the U.S. and estimates of the global distribution of chemicals, especially their tendancy to condense in cold climates such as the Canadian Arctic. There has also been some effort toward the correlation of the physico-chemical properties of contaminants.
