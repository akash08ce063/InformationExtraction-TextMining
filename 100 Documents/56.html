<hr/><h3>Steve Hadley<img height="191" src="/_images/staff/STEVE2.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="Steve Hadley" width="150"/>

<p>Steve was born many years ago when lefthanders like himself were still ridiculed for the use of the &quot;awkward appendage.&quot; The Nation was just starting to recover from the oil embargo of the early 1970&apos;s. The urban to rural migration was in full swing only to be halted shortly thereafter by the farm crisis of the 1980&apos;s. Steve learned at an early age to cook pizza, burritos, nachos, and Pop Tarts. These staples of life have fueled his efforts as he progressed to where he is today. Steve now directs the University College Advising Major Exploration Center. As part of this endeavor to assist students in choosing a major students can attend the Major Exploration EXPO which is held annually each September. Students can also work closely with Steve on choosing a major by taking the course UC 1050: Major Exploration. Steve received his B.S. and M.S. in Sociology from Utah State University. Seeing as though blood runs both red and blue depending on its level of oxygenation (Aggie blue, not that blue from the south) the University of Utah was a perfect fit. Steve also loves his wife and son, his chickens, and cycling. He rides road, mountain, and cyclocross bikes. Steve has raced his bike at the 2001 Collegiate National Championships, LOTOJA, Tour de Park City, Mt. Evans, and many others.Â&#160; Steve&apos;s advice: &quot;Eat your greens, don&apos;t do drugs, get 8 hours of sleep, ride your bike, and go to class.&quot;
<br/>
<br/>Steveâ€™s Advising Philosophy: My role as an advisor is to master knowledge so that I can analyze information and ask probing questions. In doing so, I hope to help others to know, grow, and change for the betterment of self and humanity. I am committed to helping students achieve their goals by helping them explore their options and design a degree that is unique to their interests, abilities, and values. Students ultimately have the responsibility for their education. My responsibility is to teach so that students can make decisions that are well informed.</p>

<p>Jeff joined University College in January 2012. He has been t</p>

<p>inkering with computers and related technology since he was a young child. His first computer was an Apple IIc, and although he Â&#160; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_%28video_game%29#Death">got dysentery</a> Â&#160; several times while trying to get to Oregon, he somehow survived into adulthood. When he was a teenager, the joy he got working with computers and technology turned into a full-blown passion. This might have something to do with his dial-up modem and computer crashing. He could only stare as his computer was Â&#160; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSOD">blue-screened</a> Â&#160; to death, and 28.8 kilobits of online social life were lost every second. Rather than give up, Jeff started tearing computers apart, until he had the components to make a new computer and get back into the game. Since that fateful day, Jeff has been hooked on all things tech.</p>
